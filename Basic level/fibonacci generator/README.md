# Fibonacci Sequence Generator

## Overview

This Python script generates the first n terms of the Fibonacci sequence and prints the result. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.

## Usage

Navigate to the project folder and run the following command.

```bash
python/python3 main.py <n>
```
Replace `<n>` with the number of terms you need to generate.

## Example
```bash
python3 main.py 10
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
```
